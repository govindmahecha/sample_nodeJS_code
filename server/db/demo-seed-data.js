From 3-5 years, I will focus on networking with what I believe will be my future employees at Toronto/Waterloo University. After 5 years, I will follow an entrepreneurship for wealth career path and build an organization that is meant to be acquired quickly or generate a positive cash return early from the start. I see that organization incubated either at the MaRS Discovery District at Toronto or in the Waterloo area (aka Canadian Silicon Valley), both areas have high visibility for VC funding and are attracting/nurturing top talent. After 10 years, I plan to spend more time in Tech Social Entrepreneurship with products at the frontier between psychology and technology geared for the well-being of individuals. I may actively invest in African Energy and Education sector. After 15 years, I plan to invest Other People's Money into VC and support the next generation of Tech Entrepreneurs more effectively than by giving them cash. After 20 years I plan to invest my own money, sit on the board of few organizations and spend most of my time in Social Entrepreneurship. I have plans until the end and some alternatives too because I'm convinced that society will change a lot in between. Basically this would be my ideal trajectory.",
